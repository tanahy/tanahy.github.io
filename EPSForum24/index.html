# Networking Session
## EPS Forum 2024

---

## Group Formation
#### (10 minutes)

- Groups of 4-5 people
- Different (neighbouring) countries
- Mixed education levels (Undergrad, Masters, PhD, ...)

Notes: For the groups, we will ask them to look around for 4-5 colleagues of different countries than them but that are not too far, ideally. They should look for a balance between new and old sections, if possible. If time allows, they should ask for the interests of the other group members in Physics, outreach and career prospects. We will give them 10 minutes maximum for this task.

---

### Extra Advice:
- Find people with similar interests in Physics, outreach and career prospects
- If you come from a new section, look for more experienced members

---

## Group Formation

- 4-5 people
- Different countries
- Different education level
- Maybe share interests but different seniority

---

## Do's and Dont's of Grant Applications 
### (15 minutes)

- Small chunks of made up grant applications
- 1 minute each
- Does it comply with the grant guidelines?
- Why? Write it down
---

## Example A

> #### Budget
> - Speaker accommodation: 80€
> - Food expenses:  400€
> - Gadgets: 100€

----

> #### Budget
> - Speaker accommodation: 80€
> - <span class='fragment highlight-red'> Food expenses:  400€</span>
> - <span class='fragment highlight-red'> Gadgets: 100€</span>

<p class='fragment fade-in'>300€ is the maximum amount for food expenses per year and gadgets doesn’t tell us anything about the thing you are budgeting.
</p>

---

## Example B 

> We found in our edition last year we underbudget the electronics so we have increase the expenses for those.

----

> We found in our edition <span class='fragment highlight-green'>last year</p> we underbudget the electronics so we have <span class='fragment highlight-green'>increase the expenses</p> for those.

<p class=fragment fade-in>
Please tell us about your changes for the same activity since last year, we want to know what worked and what not. It’s perfectly fine to increase your budget when it makes sense!
</p>

## Example C


> [...] and in the last part of the workshop, the students of the faculty will learn new AI tools to write latex more effectively. 
>
> #### Budget
> - 20 Lanyards: 20€
> - 20 Badges: 10€
> - 10 T-shirts: 30€
> [...]
	
----

 [...] and in the last part of the workshop, <span class='fragment highlight-red'>the students of the faculty</span> will learn new AI tools to write latex more effectively. 

 #### Budget
 - 20 <span class='fragment highlight-red'>Lanyards</span>: 20€
 - 20 <span class='fragment highlight-red'>Badges</span>: 10€
 - 10 <span class='fragment highlight-red'>T-shirts</span>: 30€
	
<p class=fragment fade-in>
We appreciate a high impact per euro in the applications. Free T-shirts for section members or fancy lanyards will not help with the networking at a small internal event in your university.
</p>

---

## Example D

> And we will gift our speakers a custom Moleskine notebook with a custom cover of their research topic (20€).


----

> And we will <span class='fragment highlight-green'>gift our speakers</span> a custom Moleskine notebook with a custom cover of their research topic <span class='fragment highlight-blue'>(20€)</span>.

<p class='fragment fade-in'>
It’s fine to give prizes to contestants or some gift to your speakers, just try to not overbudget. Think about how much it increases the impact per euro.
</p>

## Example E:

> For this workshop on DFT we will bring the expert Prof. Alfonso Muñoz to show the members of the section how to apply this modelling method in real cases.
>
> #### Budget
> - Speaker Accomodation: 80€
> - Speaker Trip: 200€
>
> [...]

----

For this workshop on DFT we will bring the expert Prof. Alfonso Muñoz to show the <span class='fragment highlight-red'>members of the section</span> how to apply this modelling method in real cases.

 #### Budget

 - <span class='fragment highlight-blue'>
Speaker Accomodation: 80€</span>
 - <span class='fragment highlight-blue'>
Speaker Trip: 200€</span>


 [...]

<p class='fragment fade-in'>
Try to use local speakers as much as possible.
Otherwise, minimize expenses. 
Do not keep activities for members only. 
</p>

Note: That is not the point of Young Minds, we want you to help your local community, not to develop on your own.

## Example F

> We plan to go around schools in our area showing these demonstrations of electromagnetism while letting the kids participate in the experiments.
>
> #### Budget
> - Tesla coil: 100€ 
> - Roll up banner: 20€
> - Posters: 150€
>
> [...]

 We plan to go around schools in our area showing these demonstrations of electromagnetism while letting the kids participate in the experiments.

 #### Budget
 - Tesla coil: 100€ 
 - <span class='fragment highlight-green'>Roll up banner</span>: 20€
 - <span class='fragment highlight-red'>Posters</span>: 150€

 [...]

<p class='fragment fade-in'>
Ads a good investment, but does it makes sense for the event? 
Even if your audience is fixed and booked? 
Roll up is good for nice pictures and reuse.

# Joint YMCA Drafts

You have 25 minutes. 

Divide into groups of 2-3 people and decide:

- Topic of the conference
    - Specific field of physics? 
    - Soft skills? 
    - Broader topics?
- Format of the conference (be creative)
- Tentative Speakers (aim for the stars)
