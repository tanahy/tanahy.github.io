My name is Tanausú Hernández-Yanes, born and raised in Canary Islands, Spain.
This is a personal website built with Quarto to share my work in physics, slides and try my hand at outreach.

### About the blog

*This Is a Pipe* is a direct reference to Magritte's painting *The Treachery of Images*, tightly bound to the concept of simulation and our perception of physical reality.

This blog is my attempt to try to visualize and explain physics models and ideas relevant to current research that explain some part of reality. 
I want to experiment with representations and physicalizations, so expect some playful attempts at bringing those ideas to life in different digital and physical forms.
